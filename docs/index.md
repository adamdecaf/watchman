## What is Watchman?

Moov Watchman is a high-performance sanctions screening and compliance tool that helps businesses meet their regulatory obligations. It provides an HTTP server and [Go library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/watchman/pkg/search#Client) for searching against multiple global sanctions and screening lists.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Integrates multiple global watchlists in one unified system
- **High-Performance Search**: Optimized for speed and accuracy using advanced matching algorithms
- **Flexible Integration**: HTTP API and Go library for easy integration into your systems
- **Automated Updates**: Regular refreshes of watchlist data to ensure compliance

## Included Lists

Watchman integrates the following lists to help you maintain global compliance:

| Source | List |
